# 2024_S1_CS373_Image_Processing_Assignment

This assignment will require you to use what we have studied in the image processing lectures to generate a software that detects New Zealand coins in the images that we have provided in the ```Images/easy``` and ```Images/hard``` folders.

You will receive 10 marks for solving the coin detection problem, and there will be an additional component for 5 marks, where you will extend upon the coin detection in a separate file, and write a short reflective report about your extension.

For more detailed description of the assignment, please see the assignment slides.
